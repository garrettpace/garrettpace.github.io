	<h1>Hi. I'm Garrett.</h1>
I'm a doctoral student in social work and sociology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. After completing a master's degree in social work, I worked at the Office of Population Research at Princeton University. My research interests include (but are not limited to) family demography, inequality, social determinants of health, incarceration, and family relationships.

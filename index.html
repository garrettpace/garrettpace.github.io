	<p>I'm a social work and sociology Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan. My primary line of research seeks to understand how discipline, punishment, and violence shape child and family wellbeing. I'm especially interested in advancing the evidence base regarding how universal interventions can prevent child maltreatment. </p>
